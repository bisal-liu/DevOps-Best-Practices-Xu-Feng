| Event black list                | Events that should be signalled by the monitor tooling are listed on the event blacklist. This means that an alert occurs when the event takes place. The operations team can then take action. | 事件黑名单          | 由监控工具报出的事件被列在事件黑名单上。这意味着当事件发生时有告警出现。运维团队可依据告警采取措施。 |          |
| Event catalogue                   | An event catalogue is a list of all events of an application including the identification and the category(information, warning or exception).  | 事件目录          | 事件目录是一个应用的所有事件列表，包括ID号和类别（信息，警告或列外）。 |          |
| Event management                     | This is an ITIL@process that defines which events are valuable to recognize and to capture.These may be information events such as starting or stopping a process. It is also possible that there is a probability of an exception.This is called a warning. An example is the 80% full disk. In case the application or infrastructure component does not function properly, there is an exception. | 事件管理          | 事件管理是ITIL@的一个流程，该流程定义了值得去辨识和捕获的所有事件。这些事件可能是信息事件，如起或停止进程。也可能有发生例外的概率。这被叫作告警，如80%的磁盘空间满了。在应用或基础设施组件不能正常工作时，就发生了一个例外。  |       |
| Event white list                       | Events that are not relevant are placed on the white list. | 事件白名单          | 不相关的事件被列在白名单上。 |          |
| Exception                         | An exception is situation in which the normal flow of an application or system software component is disturbed. | 例外         | 例外是应用或系统软件组件的正常流程出现干扰的情形。 |          |
| Exception management                          | This is a process of determining potential disturbance, programming of the exception in the software, and monitoring of the exception in order to undo the effect.     | 例外管理              | 例外管理是一个为了消除影响的过程，该过程包括确定潜在干扰、设计软件异常以及监控例外。                                   |          |
| False negative                  | The application raises an error that causes an exception, while there in fact is no error.                     | 误报          | 应用带来一个引发例外的错误，而事实上没有出现错误。                                             |    漏报？      |
| False positive                            | The application does not raise an error on an event while in reality an incorrect situation has occurred.          | 漏报              | 应用没有带来一个事件错误，但不正确的情形确实出现了。                       |    误报？      |
| Feature  | A feature is a description of a piece of functionality that should not cost more than half a DevOps cycle time. A feature is described in terms of the business. Features are the epic building blocks and are differentiated in stories. | 特性 | 特性是一项功能的描述，该功能不耗费超过一半DevOps周期时间。特性是从业务角度描述的。特性是史诗构建块，在用户故事中是不同的。 |          |
| Feature branch                        | A feature branch approach means that every story or feature is developed on a separate branch. Only after a story is accepted by testers, it is merged to the trunk so as to ensure that the trunk is always releasable.  | 特性分支               | 特性分支方法意味着每个故事或特性被作为一个单独的分支进行开发。仅在故事被测试人员认可后，分支才能被合并到主干，以保证主干总是可发布的。                         |                  |
| Feature splitting                             | There are two ways to subdivide features across DevOps teams,namely a vertical feature split and a horizontal feature split.A vertical split of a feature means that one DevOps team will handle the feature.A horizontal split of a feature means that more than one DevOps team is involved in the realisation of the feature.  | 特性划分               | 业务案例是定义开始新举措的收益和成本的一种方式。 风险也要考虑在内，因为风险的对策也要付出时间和金钱。 |                  |
| Flow                                | Within DevOps, often the Lean principles are used. One of the most appealing is flow.A DevOps team should deliver products by working in a particular cadence with no waiting times and no repairs.Therefore, a maximum time to market is realized with the least cost and the desired quality. | 流                 | 精益原则常常被用于DevOps实践中。流是最受偏爱的原则之一。一个DevOps团队应该以一种无等待时间、无修复的特定节奏交付产品。因此，产品投放市场的最大时间以最小的成本和期望的质量得以实现。 |                  |
| Forward Releasing                        | Forward Releasing is a concept that does not create any branches (release branches only) in the entire DTAP street,and no older versions can be restored.If there has been a bug in the T-A-P environment then the correction must be generated by the deployment pipeline.| 前向发布               | 前向发布是一个在整个DTAP环节中不建立任何分支（仅发布分支）的概念，且没有旧版本可恢复。如果在T-A-P环境中出现任何Bug，那么纠正必须要通过部署流水线来生成。 |                  |
| Functional Acceptance Test (FAT)                            | The functional acceptance test is used to verify that the happy path of the application works conform the functional requirements. The alternate path and error path should be tested too. | 功能验收测试               | 功能验收测试用于验证应用快乐路经的工作符合功能需求。替代路经和错误路径也应该被测试。 |                  |
| Functional Decomposition                                 | This concept describes the idea that the realization of a product or service can take place from coarse to fine. In this way, the realization of ideas in the funnel,roadmap planning,release planning and sprint planning is completed.                                        | 功能分解                   | 这个概念描述了一个产品或服务可以采用从粗略到精细的方式来实现。以这种方式，想法是按照漏斗、路线图规划、发布规划和冲刺规划来实现的。                                           |                  |
| Functional design                             | A functional design describes what needs to be built. | 功能设计               | 功能设计描述了需要构建的功能。 |                  |
